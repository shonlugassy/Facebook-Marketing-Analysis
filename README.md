# Facebook Marketing Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Facebook ad campaigns for three companies to assess their performance across key marketing metrics. The analysis includes Conversion Rate, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Retention Rate, Return on Investment (ROI), Revenue per Campaign and so on. The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of each campaign and helps to identify areas for optimization to improve overall marketing performance.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) website.

## Key Marketing Metrics Analysis
- **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase or sign-up) after interacting with an ad. A higher rate indicates campaign effectiveness. 
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** The total revenue a company can expect from a customer over the duration of their relationship. A higher CLV indicates greater long-term profitability.
- **Retention Rate:** The percentage of customers who continue to engage with a company over a specific period. A higher retention rate indicates successful customer loyalty and satisfaction.
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** A measure of the profitability of an investment, calculated by comparing the net profit to the cost of the investment. A higher ROI indicates more effective use of marketing resources.
- **Revenue per Campaign:** The total revenue generated from a specific ad campaign. This metric helps assess the financial success and effectiveness of each campaign in driving sales.
